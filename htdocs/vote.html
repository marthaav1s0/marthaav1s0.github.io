				<h3>Know what time and where</h3>
				<p>Double check and familiarize yourself with the location of your polling precinct, or where you will cast your vote. You can check this online through the Comelec’s website, <a href="https://comelec.gov.ph/">https://comelec.gov.ph/</a> or their social media: Twitter <b>(@comelec)</b>, Facebook <b>(fb.com/comelec.ph)</b>, or their mobile, <b>09275595926</b>.</p>

				<h3>Prepare before the day</h3>
				<p>Prepare lists of who you will vote for before the elections. You can bring your list of who to vote for but remember do not bring any campaign materials. On the day of the voting, bring a water bottle to cool down from the heat of the summer and if you are a person with disability you can bring a companion to help you. There will be teachers on standby in the polling precinct to assist the voters.</p>

				<h3>Identify yourself</h3>
				<p>Find your name on the voters’ list posted by your polling precinct where you will verify that you’re a registered voter in that area designated by the Comelec and know what room in the precinct you will go to vote.</p>
				<p>There will be areas in the Philippines where they will use Comelec’s new voter registration verification machine or what they call VRVM that uses fingerprint scanning technology to verify a voter’s identity and whether or not he or she is registered in a certain precinct.</p>

				<h3>Get your ballot</h3>
				<p>To get your ballot, secrecy folder, and your marking pen, you should approach the board of elections inspectors (BEI) chairperson. Take note that there is no need to bring your own pen as the Comelec’s marking pens are designed for its ballots and VCMs. If your area uses the Comelec’s new fingerprint scanning machine, the BEI chairperson will issue you the materials needed after the machine issues you a verification receipt.</p>

				<h3>Choose your candidates</h3>
				<p>After getting your ballot, you will now vote for your chosen candidates. Remember to vote only for the number indicated by each position:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Senator – vote for a maximum of 12 candidates</li>
					<li>House of Representatives – vote for a maximum of 1 candidate</li>
					<li>Mayor – vote for a maximum of 1 candidate</li>
					<li>Vice mayor – vote for a maximum of 1 candidate</li>						<li>Party-list – vote for a maximum of 1 group</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When voting, refrain from placing extra markings on your ballot. The Comelec suggests filling out the entire circle beside a candidate’s name to make sure it is counted by the VCM.</p>

				<h3>Cast your ballot</h3>
				<p>After voting, wait for the machine to process your ballot. Once this is done, a poll clerk will mark your finger with indelible ink and will give you your voting receipt to review. Check your voting receipt to see if it correctly reflects who you voted for. If the receipt does not match who you voted for, bring it to the BEI to register your complaint. This will then be put on record. If the receipt matches who you voted for, drop it in the voting receipt box once done. Once this is done, you’ve finished voting! </p>
